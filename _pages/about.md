## Hi there!

I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Murcia. I am interested in everything related to evaluating and improving our scientific practices. For this reason, my research focus so far has been on conducting empirical meta-research about aspects such as the adequacy of methodological practices (with a special emphasis on meta-analysis), transparency, and the implementation of Open Science practices. Iâ€™m also interested in other meta-scientific topics such as how we should evaluate research, which includes aspects such as the critical appraisal of primary studies in evidence synthesis, peer review or hiring decisions at academic environments.

If you have any question, feel free to reach me at [alejandro.sandovall@um.es](mailto:alejandro.sandovall@um.es).
