I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Murcia. Generally speaking, I am interested in everything related to evaluating and improving our scientific practices. For doing so, my research focus so far has been on conducting empirical meta-research about aspects such as the adequacy of methodological practices, reproducibility, and the implementation of Open Science practices, with a special focus on meta-analysis. I'm also interested in other meta-scientific topics such as how we should evaluate research, which includes aspects such as peer review or hiring decisions at academic environments.
