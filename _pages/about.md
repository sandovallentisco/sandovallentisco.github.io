I am a postdoctoral fellow at the [Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS)](https://metrics.stanford.edu/). Previously, I was a postdoc at the [CALL](https://calluam.wordpress.com/) (Universidad Autónoma de Madrid), and I received my PhD in Psychology from the University of Murcia. I am interested in everything related to evaluating and improving our scientific practices. My research focus has been on conducting empirical meta-research about aspects such as the adequacy of our methodological practices (with a special emphasis on evidence synthesis), transparency, and the implementation of Open Science practices. I’m also interested in other meta-scientific topics such as science self-correction mechanisms or how we should evaluate research, which includes aspects such as the appraisal of primary studies in evidence synthesis, peer review or hiring decisions at academic environments.
