I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Murcia. I am interested in everything related to evaluating and improving our scientific practices. For this reason, my research focus so far has been on conducting empirical meta-research about aspects such as the adequacy of methodological practices (with a special emphasis on meta-analysis), reproducibility, and the implementation of Open Science practices. I'm also interested in other meta-scientific topics such as how we should evaluate research, which includes aspects such as peer review or hiring decisions at academic environments.
