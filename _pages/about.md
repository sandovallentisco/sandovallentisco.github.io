I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the [Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS)](https://metrics.stanford.edu/). Previously, I was a postdoc at the [CALL](https://calluam.wordpress.com/) at Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, and I earned my PhD in Psychology from the University of Murcia. 

I'm interested in everything related to evaluating and improving our scientific practices. For this reason, my research focuses on conducting meta-research on the adequacy of methodological and transparency practices, with a special emphasis on evidence synthesis. I’m also interested in broader meta-scientific topics such as mechanisms of scientific self-correction and how research should be evaluated, including the appraisal of primary studies in evidence synthesis, peer review, and academic hiring decisions.
